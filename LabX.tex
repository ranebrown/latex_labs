\section*{Purpose}
	Lab X is designed to review the basics of feedback control. This will be accomplished through a series of procedures that analyze a cruise control system. The end goal of this project is to gain enough knowledge and background information to create a feasible control solution for use with the torsion disk system.

\section*{Background}
	Feedback is important in nature and technology. Without feedback life as we know it would not exist and the technological marvels that exits today would not be possible. There are numerous example of existing feedback systems but a few of the most important are listed below.

	\subsection*{E1}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Airplane: The autopilot can be set to maintain a level orientation at a given altitude. Disturbances in the air may cause the wings to dip and this movement is read by a gyroscope. The information from the gyroscope is read by the control system and adjustments are made to the ailerons to bring the plane back to a level orientation.
			\item Thermostat: The user can select a desired temperature and the thermostat will compare this value to the measured temperature. If hot air from outside the house raises the temperature above the set value the ac will be activated. 
			\item Climate change: Greenhouse gases increase the Earth's temperature and this rise in temperature increases water vapor in the air. The increase in water vapor further increases the Earth's temperature. In addition, there is ice albedo feedback where the reduction of ice due to melting reduces the amount of reflected radiation and therefore the surface temperature rises which leads to further ice melting.
			\item Metabolism: The metabolism of an animal is adjusted depending on food intake. As the food intake decreases the metabolism slows and vice versa.
		\end{enumerate}

\section*{Procedure}
	A simple example of a feedback system that has wide spread real world application is cruise control. The most common example of this appears in vehicles. The driver can set the desired speed and the feedback system will maintain that speed in the presence of disturbances such as wind and hills. \\

	\noindent As seen in Figure \ref{fig:block} there are two inputs signal to the cruise control feedback system: the reference $R(s)$ and the disturbance $D(s)$. There is one output signal $Y(s)$ for this system but there are many other points of interest as labeled in Figure \ref{fig:block}. With these signals many useful transfer functions can be derived that will help in the selection of an appropriate controller $C(s)$. The selection for $C(s)$ is dependent on many factors including desired rise time, settle time, overshoot, and steady state error. \\

		\noindent Table \ref{table:SaTF} provides definitions for the signals and transfer functions that will be used for the remainder of Lab X. Common notation will be to exclude the $(s)$ when writing equations i.e. $R(s)$ will be represented as $R$.

	\subsection*{E2}
		The first transfer of function of interest is from the input $R$ to the output $Y$. This transfer function can be found by setting the disturbance $D$ to zero and chasing the signals from figure \ref{fig:block}. The reason it is possible to set $D=0$ and find an individual piece of the overall transfer function is due to the principle of superposition.
		\begin{equation}
			H_{yr}=\frac{Y}{R}=\frac{CP}{1+CP}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:Hyr}
			\mbox{ Substituting in for P yields: } H_{yr}=\frac{Ck}{(s+b)+Ck}
		\end{equation} 
	
	\subsection*{E3}
		A second transfer function of interest is from the disturbance $D$ to the output $Y$. Once again, the principle of superposition can be utilized to find the desired transfer function $H_{yd}$. This time the input $R$ is set to 0. In this case, it can be seen that ``$b\geq 0$ indicates dissipation (friction, wind, etc...) and $k\geq 0$ indicates that a positive command should result in an increase in velocity''
		\begin{equation}
			H_{yd}=\frac{Y}{D}=\frac{P}{1+CP}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:Hyd}
			\mbox{ Substituting in for P yields: } H_{yd}=\frac{k}{(s+b)+Ck}
		\end{equation}

	\subsection*{E4}
		The purpose of a feedback control system is to design the controller $C$ in such a manner that the output behaves as desired. A controller that commands an acceleration proportional to the velocity error is proportional feedback. $$u(t)=k_p(r(t)-y(t))$$ This is an example of a negative feedback system. For sections E4-E8 a proportional controller will be used: $$C=C_p=k_p$$ Substituting this proportional controller into equations \ref{eq:Hyr} and \ref{eq:Hyd} gives the following transfer functions.
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:propHyr}
			 H_{yr}=\frac{k_pk}{(s+b)+k_pk}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:propHyd}
			H_{yd}=\frac{k}{(s+b)+k_pk}
		\end{equation}
		Examination of these two transfer functions shows that there are no zeros in either case. The poles of the two transfer functions are identical at $s=-b-k_pk$. In order for the system to be BIBO stable there can be no right-half-plane poles or zeros. For this to be true $$k_p>\frac{-s-b}{k}$$

	\subsection*{E5}
		Another useful piece of information is the impulse response of $H_{yr}$. The impulse response $h_{yr}(t)$ can be found by taking the inverse laplace transform of $H_{yr}$.
		\begin{align}
			H_{yr}&=\frac{k_pk}{(s+b)+k_pk}=(k_pk)\frac{1}{s-(-b-k_pk)} \\
			h(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{H_{yr}\} = k_pk\exp\{{-t(b+k_pk)}\} \label{eq:imp}
		\end{align} 		
		The impulse response found in equation \ref{eq:imp} can be used to find the time constant of the system. Equation \ref{eq:imp} is of the form $e^{-t/\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the time constant of interest. 
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:tconst}
			\mbox{ time const. }\frac{1}{\tau}=(b+k_pk)\implies \tau=\frac{1}{(b+k_pk)}
		\end{equation}
		For a desired time constant of 2 seconds a suitable value of $k_p$ for the proportional controller is:
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:2stau}
			k_p=\frac{1-2b}{2k}
		\end{equation}
		\textcolor{red}{!!! A suitable time constant for the torsion disc system is: !!!}

	\subsection*{E6}
		We can model the cruise control system in Simulink, using proportional controller $$C=C_p=k_p+k_I\frac{1}{s}$$ First we experiment with a step reference input at $t=1: r(t)=1(t-1)$ and a disturbance input $d(t)=0$. The results of this simulation are shown in the plot below. top left = r(t) and d(t), top right = u(t), bottom left = e(t), bottom right = y(t)
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e6-1}
			\caption{Step Reference 0 Distrubance}
		\end{figure}
		
		Next we introduce a step disturbance input at $t=2: d(t)=1(t-2)$ and zero reference input. The results of the simulation are plotted below. top left = r(t) and d(t), top right = u(t), bottom left = e(t), bottom right = y(t)
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e6-2}
			\caption{0 Reference Step Distrubance}
		\end{figure}	
		
		If we apply both a step reference input $r(t)=1(t-1)$ and a step disturbance $d(t)=1(t-2)$, we see that \textcolor{red}{! discussion here !}
		top left = r(t) and d(t), top right = u(t), bottom left = e(t), bottom right = y(t)
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e6-3}
			\caption{Step Reference Step Distrubance}
		\end{figure}
		
	\subsection*{E7}
		To determine the system's steady state error with respect to disturbance rejection, we use transfer function 
		\begin{equation}
			H_{ed}=\frac{E}{D}=\frac{-P}{1+CP}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:propHed}
			\mbox{ Substituting in for C and P yields: } H_{ed}=\frac{-k}{(s+b)+k_pk}
		\end{equation}
		The steady state error with respect to the disturbance can be found using the final value theorem: 
		\begin{equation}
			\lim_{t\to\infty}e(t)=\lim_{s\to0}sE(s)
		\end{equation}
		When $r(t)=0$ and $d(t)=1(t)$, the error is
		\begin{equation}
			e_{ss}=\lim_{s\to0}s\frac{E}{D}D=\lim_{s\to0}s\frac{-k}{s+b+k_pk}\frac{1}{s}=\frac{-k}{b+k_pk}
		\end{equation}
		when we assume $k_p$ is in the stability range, i.e. $k_p > \frac{-b}{k}$. \\\\
		If we include a nonzero reference input, e.g. $r(t)=1(t)$, the error signal is no longer $E=-Y$; we must now include the reference signal in calculations of transfer function $H_{ed}'=\frac{E}{D}$:
		\begin{equation}
			H_{ed}'=\frac{E}{D}=\frac{-(s+b+k)}{s+b+k_pk}
		\end{equation}
		So with a nonzero reference input our steady state error with respect to disturbance becomes
		\begin{equation}
			e_{ss}=\lim_{s\to0}s\frac{-(s+b+k)}{s+b+k_pk}\frac{1}{s}=\frac{-(b+k)}{b+k_pk}
			\end{equation}
		while there is an additional term in the numerator, the error remains finite and the system type with respect to disturbance rejection does not change. By choosing $k_p$ arbitrarily large this error can be made zero.\\\\
		
		For a constant acceleration disturbance input the steady state error cannot be made zero. The steady state error in this case becomes
		$$e_{ss}=\lim_{s\to0}s\frac{-(s+b+k)}{s+b+k_pk}\frac{1}{s^2} =\infty$$
		
		This result was verified via simulation in Simulink; plots for error output with large $k_p$ are included below. \\
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e7}
			\caption{Error for large $k_p$}
		\end{figure}
		When there is a measurment and/or acutation bias a similiar effect can be observed when looking at the error signal. This is because \textcolor{red}{! why??? !}
		
	\subsection*{E8}
		The result observed for a constant acceleration input is similar to that observed for actuator or measurement biases. An actuator bias does not allow accurate knowledge of the transfer function $H_yr$, thus additional nonzero error is introduced. Similarly, Measurement bias does not allow accurate knowledge of the error signal. $E\neq R-Y$; an additional error noise function is introduced but not accounted for by our model. To account for these biases in our system we could include additional blocks for actuator and measurement bias, $B(s)$ and $H(s)$, respectfully, as shown below.

	\subsection*{E9}
		In order to ensure a cruise control feedback system has zero steady state error in the face of a constant disturbance input, integral feedback can be introduced along with proportional control. The PI controller is now:
	\begin{equation}
		C_{PI}=k_p+k_I\frac{1}{s}
	\end{equation}
	With this new controller, we can derive $H_{yr}(s)$ and $H_{yd}(s)$ as follows:
	\begin{equation}
		H_{yr}(s)=\frac{C_{PI}P}{1+C_{PI}P}=\frac{(k_p+k_I)s}{s^2+(b+k_pk)s+k_Ik}
	\end{equation}	
	\begin{equation}
		H_{yd}(s)=\frac{P}{1+C_PIP}=\frac{ks}{s^2+(b+k_pk)s+k_Ik}
	\end{equation}\\
	$H_{yr}(s)$ and $H_{yd}(s)$ have the same characteristic equation, and thus have common poles as well as a common zero at $s=0$.
	
	\subsection*{E10}
	The characteristic polynomial of the system with the new PI controller becomes 
	\begin{equation}
		s^2+(b+k_pk)s+k_Ik=0
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection*{E11}
		We can determine the stability of the system from this characteristic equation using the Routh Stability Criterion:\\\\
	\newcommand{\tab}[1]{\hspace{.2\textwidth}\rlap{#1}}
	\tab{$s^2$}  \tab{1} \tab{$k_Ik$}\\
	\tab{$s^1$} \tab{$b+k_p$} \tab{0}\\
	\tab{$s^0$} \tab{$k_Ik$} \tab{0}\\\\ 
	For the system to be BIBO stable, we need
	\begin{equation}
		b+k_p>0\implies k_p>-b
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		k_Ik>0\implies k_I>0
	\end{equation}
	for $k>0$
	
	\subsection*{E12}
		Assuming both $k_p$ and $k_I$ are within the region for system stability, we can determine the steady state error of the system with a PI controller for a step disturbance input $d(t)=1(t)$ and zero reference input $r(t)=0$:
	\begin{align}
		e_{ss}&=\lim_{t\to \infty}e(t)=\lim_{s\to 0}sE(s)\\
		&=\lim_{s\to 0}\frac{-ks}{s^2+(b+k_pk)s+k_ik}=0
	\end{align}
	The system can reject a constant disturbance input perfectly, with zero steady state error. 
	
	\subsection*{E13}
	A PI controller can be used in simulink to view the effects for different values of $k_I$. As $k_I$ is increased the rise time decreases but the overshoot and settle time both increase. The advantage of adding integral control is that steady state error can be eliminated for a step or ramp input. Below is a snapshot of the modified system in simulink as well as plots for various values of $k_I$.
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e13-1}

		\caption{Large $k_I$}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection*{E14}
		The introduction of an integrator means we must now consider other aspects of the transient response in addition to steady state error. Overshoot and damping are must be considered as well for a well-functioning system. To more easily understand how our chosen parameters $k_p$ and $k_I$, affect overshoot and damping, we consider the characteristic equation in the form 
	\begin{equation}
		s^2+2\xi\omega_ns+\omega_n^2
	\end{equation} 
	where $\omega_n$ is the natural frequency and $\xi$ is the damping ratio.
	Both $k_p$ and $k_I$ can be determined in terms of $\omega_n$ and $\xi$:
	\begin{equation}
		b+k_pk=2\xi \omega_n \implies k_p=\frac{2\xi \omega_n-b}{k}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		k_Ik=\omega_n^2 \implies k_i=\frac{\omega_n^2}{k}
	\end{equation}
	For the system to be stable, we need $\xi >0$ and $\omega_N >0$. This agrees with the stability region we obtained from using Routh's Stability Criterion, we need $k_Ik>0$ and $k_pk+b>0$ for stability.
	
	\subsection*{E15}
		If we consider an experiment that began long before time $t=0$ with $r(t)=0$ and $d(t)=1(-t)$ and assume all signals are constant at $t=0$, we can verify that for $t=0$, we have signals\\
		$e(t)=0$, $u(t)=-1$, $a(t)=0$, and $y(t)=0$.
	Since we assume we are using PI control for the system, there will be zero steady state error, so we know that $e(t)=0$ at $t=0$. Furthermore, 
	\begin{align*}
		y(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}Y(s)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}E(s)-R(s)=0\\
		u(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}A(s)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s)-D(s))\\
		&=0--(-1)\\
		&=-1\\
		a(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}A(s)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}(U(s)+D(s))=0
	\end{align*}
	Our disturbance input becomes 0 at $t=0$, and again, because we have a PI controller, as $t\to \infty$, with $d(t)=0$ for $t>0$, $e(t)$ will be 0, and thus $u(t)\to0$, $y(t)\to0$ and $a(t)\to0$:
	\begin{align*}
		y(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}Y(s)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}E(s)-R(s)=0\\
		u(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}A(s)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s)-D(s))=0\\
		a(t)&=\mathcal{L}^{-1}A(s)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}(U(s)+D(s))=0
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsection*{E16}
		A cruise control system should provide zero steady state error for both tracking a constant velocity reference and rejecting constant acceleration disturbances, hills and bumps for example. Additionally, the response should be quick, but not so fast that a the system does not ensure a smooth acceleration. Thus, if a step function is applied as the reference input, the system should not seek to match that input exactly. Other considerations include good damping - the speed should increase or decrease to meet the constant reference, then remain steady, with minimal oscillations, as well as little to no overshoot - we don't want the user to get a speeding ticket.\\\\
		For such a system, a value of $k_p=??$ and $k_I=?$ will provide the $e_{ss}=0$ for tracking a constant input and rejecting disturbances, a suitable rise time, good damping and little overshoot.
